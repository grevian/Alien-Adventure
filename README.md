Alien-Adventure
===============

A very simple text based game created for COSC2946 at Algoma University. Written in about an hour.

You can describe rooms and their connections as a directed graph, place enemies and items in each room, write descriptions, etc. 

The important things don't really work, you can attack enemies but they will never die or attack you back, you cannot pick up items, you cannot win you can only die by entering a room with no exit.

This game was written in about an hour, I am happy enough with the game framework, even though it is incomplete it would be easy to finish. The content is sparse but gets the point across.

Press "Q" at any time to quit, otherwise follow the menu choices.
